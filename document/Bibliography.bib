	abstract = "This paper presents AutoGOAL, a system for automatic machine learning (AutoML) that uses heterogeneous techniques. In contrast with existing AutoML approaches, our contribution can automatically build machine learning pipelines that combine techniques and algorithms from different frameworks, including shallow classifiers, natural language processing tools, and neural networks. We define the heterogeneous AutoML optimization problem as the search for the best sequence of algorithms that transforms specific input data into the desired output. This provides a novel theoretical and practical approach to AutoML. Our proposal is experimentally evaluated in diverse machine learning problems and compared with alternative approaches, showing that it is competitive with other AutoML alternatives in standard benchmarks. Furthermore, it can be applied to novel scenarios, such as several NLP tasks, where existing alternatives cannot be directly deployed. The system is freely available and includes in-built compatibility with a large number of popular machine learning frameworks, which makes our approach useful for solving practical problems with relative ease and effort.",

    to those without expertise in statistics and computer science. These systems have
    gained traction in enterprise settings where pools of skilled data workers are limited.
    In this study, we conduct interviews with 29 individuals from organizations of different
    sizes to characterize how they currently use, or intend to use, AutoML systems in
    their data science work. Our investigation also captures how data visualization is
    used in conjunction with AutoML systems. Our findings identify three usage scenarios
    for AutoML that resulted in a framework summarizing the level of automation desired
    by data workers with different levels of expertise. We surfaced the tension between
    speed and human oversight and found that data visualization can do a poor job balancing
    the two. Our findings have implications for the design and implementation of human-in-the-loop
    visual analytics approaches.},
