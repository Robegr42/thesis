    abstract = {We explore trust in a relatively new area of data science: Automated Machine Learning
    (AutoML). In AutoML, AI methods are used to generate and optimize machine learning
    models by automatically engineering features, selecting models, and optimizing hyperparameters.
    In this paper, we seek to understand what kinds of information influence data scientists'
    trust in the models produced by AutoML? We operationalize trust as a willingness to
    deploy a model produced using automated methods. We report results from three studies
    - qualitative interviews, a controlled experiment, and a card-sorting task - to understand
    the information needs of data scientists for establishing trust in AutoML systems.
    We find that including transparency features in an AutoML tool increased user trust
    and understandability in the tool; and out of all proposed features, model performance
    metrics and visualizations are the most important information to data scientists when
    establishing their trust with an AutoML tool.},

    abstract = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is changing our lives in many
    ways. One application domain is data science. New techniques in automating the creation
    of AI, known as AutoAI or AutoML, aim to automate the work practices of data scientists.
    AutoAI systems are capable of autonomously ingesting and pre-processing data, engineering
    new features, and creating and scoring models based on a target objectives (e.g. accuracy
    or run-time efficiency). Though not yet widely adopted, we are interested in understanding
    how AutoAI will impact the practice of data science. We conducted interviews with
    20 data scientists who work at a large, multinational technology company and practice
    data science in various business settings. Our goal is to understand their current
    work practices and how these practices might change with AutoAI. Reactions were mixed:
    while informants expressed concerns about the trend of automating their jobs, they
    also strongly felt it was inevitable. Despite these concerns, they remained optimistic
    about their future job security due to a view that the future of data science work
    will be a collaboration between humans and AI systems, in which both automation and
    human expertise are indispensable.},

    abstract = { AutoML systems can speed up routine data science work and make machine learning available
    to those without expertise in statistics and computer science. These systems have
    gained traction in enterprise settings where pools of skilled data workers are limited.
    In this study, we conduct interviews with 29 individuals from organizations of different
    sizes to characterize how they currently use, or intend to use, AutoML systems in
    their data science work. Our investigation also captures how data visualization is
    used in conjunction with AutoML systems. Our findings identify three usage scenarios
    for AutoML that resulted in a framework summarizing the level of automation desired
    by data workers with different levels of expertise. We surfaced the tension between
    speed and human oversight and found that data visualization can do a poor job balancing
    the two. Our findings have implications for the design and implementation of human-in-the-loop
    visual analytics approaches.},
